<IntroParagraph>Design system library ♥️ optimizing compiler ♥️ UI kit</IntroParagraph>

- Create React Native and web apps at the same time with the `@tamagui/core` and the `styled()` function that supports fully typed design systems, variants, and more. Use it as a lightweight library to build your a complete UI kit with design system on top of React Native and React Native web.

- Add the `@tamagui/static` compiler for partial analysis of all types of common JSX patterns, pulling logic and styling out of your render functions, and often flattening your React tree for significant performance gains.

- If you like it, add the highly customizable `tamagui` UI Kit for building full-featured app interfaces right out of the box. Featuring powerful, themable components that scale across every size in your design system. Enjoy Radix-like composable component APIs that always visually adapt properly to each platform.

### Hooks

Inline typed theme and media props accompany `useTheme` and `useMedia` hooks, so you have everything you need to build truly cross-platform UIs without sacrificing DX or performance.

### SSR and Server Components

Tamagui fully supports cross-browser server-side rendering ([see how we do it with Next.js](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/apps/site)), even for themes, responsive styles and variants. It has beta support for React Server Components.

### Variants

[Variants](/docs/core/styled#variants) as a first-class citizen, so you can design composable component APIs. Define a single variant, multiple variants, and even [Spread Variants](/docs/core/styled#spread-variants) which allow you to return dynamic styles, even at compile-time.

### Shorthands

[Shorthands](/docs/core/configuration#shorthands) allow you to map shorthand properties to their longer cousins. This lets you create Tailwinds-like quick properties to style. These work with TypeScript as well, and are designed so you can bring them with you across different tamagui component kits.

### Tokens

Define your own [tokens](/docs/core/configuration) and seamlessly apply them as CSS values. CSS Properties are automatically mapped to token scales. Tokens can even be used in shorthand CSS properties.

### Themes

Tamagui has [powerful theming](/docs/intro/themes). Create as many themes as you need, and apply them wherever you want. Each theme generates a CSS class name which overrides the default tokens.

### Media Queries

Tamagui lets you configure [media queries](/docs/core/use-media) and apply variants responsively using `$` props.

### Animations

Plug-in [animations](/docs/core/animations) with incredibly simple syntax.

### Fonts

A unique font system means you can publish and share font bundles including all their styles, vertical rhythms and all, and still get all the benefits of compilation speed.

### Debugging

Tamagui provides a fully-typed API so all your TypeScript style properties, values, media queries and shorthands will be auto-completed for you. It provides a `// debug` pragma and `debug` prop that both allow easy introspection into whats happening at compile and runtime. In dev mode it puts a `data-` attribute that links every DOM node back to your original source.
