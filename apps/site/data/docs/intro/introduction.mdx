<IntroParagraph>Design system library ♥️ optimizing compiler ♥️ UI kit</IntroParagraph>

- Create React Native and web apps at the same time with the `@tamagui/core` and the `styled()` function that supports fully typed design systems, variants, and more.

- Add the `@tamagui/static` compiler for partial analysis of all types of common JSX patterns pulling styles out of your render functions and often flattening your React tree.

- A large UI kit `tamagui` with Radix-like composable component APIs, consistently themable and sizable using your defined tokens.

### Themed, Responsive

Inline typed theme and media props, and accompanying `useTheme` and `useMedia` hooks work how you'd expect them to, but also compile away.

### Faster

Outputs minimal atomic CSS, media queries and turns nested styled components into flatter underlying views.

### Server-Side Rendered

Tamagui fully supports cross-browser server-side rendering ([see how we do it with Next.js](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/apps/site)), even for themes, responsive styles and variants.

### Variants

[Variants](/docs/core/styled#variants) as a first-class citizen, so you can design composable component APIs. Define a single variant, multiple variants, and even [Spread Variants](/docs/core/styled#spread-variants) which allow you to return dynamic styles, even at compile-time.

### Tokens

Define your own [tokens](/docs/intro/configuration) and seamlessly apply them as CSS values. CSS Properties are automatically mapped to token scales. Tokens can even be used in shorthand CSS properties.

### Themes

Tamagui has [powerful theming](/docs/intro/themes). Create as many themes as you need, and apply them wherever you want. Each theme generates a CSS class name which overrides the default tokens.

### Shorthands

[Shorthands](/docs/intro/configuration#shorthands) allow you to map shorthand properties to their longer cousins. This lets you create Tailwinds-like quick properties to style. These work with TypeScript as well, and are designed so you can bring them with you across different tamagui component kits.

### Responsivity

Tamagui lets you configure [media queries](/docs/core/use-media) and apply variants responsively using `$` props.

### Animations

Plug-in [animations](/docs/core/animations) with incredibly simple syntax.

### Fonts

A unique font system means you can publish and share font bundles including all their styles, vertical rhythms and all, and still get all the benefits of compilation speed.

### Hooks

The `useMedia` and `useTheme` hooks work reactively, avoiding re-renders, while giving you the same typed access as your normally have to your design system values. They work with the compiler as well when possible.

### Developer Experience

Tamagui provides a fully-typed API so all your TypeScript style properties, values, media queries and shorthands will be auto-completed for you. It provides a `// debug` pragma and `debug` prop that both allow easy introspection into whats happening at compile and runtime. In dev mode it puts a `data-` attribute that links every DOM node back to your original source.
