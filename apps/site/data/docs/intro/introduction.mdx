<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui is a design system that works with an optimizing compiler. On top we've added a UI kit
  that aims with one set of components to adapt natively for each platform React Native and React
  Native Web support.
</IntroParagraph>

#### Core

A complete UI kit builder for your next web, native, or universal app.

It generates fully typed design systems (colors, tokens, spacing, sizing, fonts, and more) that work with both a powerful [styled() component Factory](/docs/core/styled) with features like variants, media queries, themes, pseudo styles and more.

Plus base `<Stack />` and `<Text />` components give you nicely typed short inline styles, lots of helpful built-in features, and animations through pluggable animation drivers. Use it as a lightweight library to build your a complete UI kit with design system on top of React Native and React Native web.

#### Static

Add [the @tamagui/static compiler](/docs/intro/compiler) for all types of optimization and CSS extraction.

#### Tamagui

Above that, [the Tamagui UI Kit](/docs/components/stacks) for building full-featured app interfaces right out of the box. Featuring powerful, themable components that scale across every size in your design system. Enjoy Radix-like composable component APIs that always visually adapt properly to each platform.
