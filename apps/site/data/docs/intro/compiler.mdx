title: Bye, frontend trilemma
description: Getting ~2x the performance in ~½ the code.

<IntroParagraph>
  If you're developing a cross-platform app, you've made an implicit decision. This decision can be
  thought of as a **frontend development trilemma**, illustrated as a choose-two-of-three:
</IntroParagraph>

<YStack w="100%" mih={500} my="$-10" als="center" $gtMd={{ my: '$4' }}>
  <Image
    title="The Frontend Trilemma: Choose two of DX, UX, and multi-platform"
    src="/trilemma.svg"
    size="hero"
    height={270 * 2}
    width={270 * 2}
    resizeMode="contain"
  />
</YStack>

React Native recommends writing things twice generally for the best UX - as is made very clear in the `<title>` of the homepage itself: "[learn once, write anywhere](https://reactnative.dev/)" as opposed to "write once, runs everywhere". This pays off today with native-feeling and performing apps while still saving much development time.

But we can imagine that center, the sort of platonic ideal of <strong>"write once, runs great everywhere"</strong>, as we're still pretty far from it. It would involve a few things:

- Some Rails-for-React framework with unified routing, generators, or whatever "all the batteries" means.
- A huge UI kit that outputs to beautiful platform primitives confidently with flexible APIs.
- An optimizing compiler that removes inline styles and outputs to native primitives.

This document goes over the last one. The second one Tamagui UI is attempting, slowly, and the first just sounds hard.

**The hope is to make another "bump" like the one React Native Web made here:**

<YStack w="100%" mih={220} my="$4" als="center" $gtMd={{ scale: 1.5, my: 100 }}>
  <Image
    title="How possible it is to share more code: a lot more with React Native, and again with React Native Web"
    src="/code-sharing.svg"
    size="hero"
    height={220}
    width={380}
    resizeMode="contain"
  />
</YStack>

This can be done especially on the web by reducing JS bundle size by a large % and greatly increasing render performance with reduced tree depth, logic, objects, and hooks. The Tamagui Compiler these all using partial evaluation, static hoisting, code elimination, and tree-flattening.

You can [skip to the technical details without the backstory](#how-tamagui-helps) from here if you'd like.

Universal apps (those that you "write once" and they "runs everywhere") make sense today for many cases, whether side-projecting, SEO-insensitive, enterprise-only, shipping faster, experimenting more, pre product-market fit, or just generally have a simple UI. Twitter and Tinder are both examples, to a significant degree.

But today, at best, we use hooks for media queries and themes, which basically touch most component. This causes whole-tree re-renders of expensive main-thread time on the web. Combine that with the CSS-in-JS approach of React Native Web greatly increasing bundle size, and even medium-complexity pages will drop from 100% Lighthouse to half or worse (our homepage, a good complex example due to showing off many features goes from in the 20s without the compiler on (and using well-written code that was optimized many times for low CLS, etc) to over 85 (though Lighthouse and it's seemingly stochastic scoring is another story).

All your media queries, interactive styles, themes, animations, and dynamic styles end up running on your main thread, and its easy to feel, especially if you want to make ambitious apps.

### How Tamagui Helps

`@tamagui/static` is an optimizing compiler for React Native with four main features:

<YStack py="$4">
  <Features
    size="$5"
    items={[
      `Extracts all types of styling syntax into atomic CSS.`,
      `Removes a high % of inline styles with partial evaluation and hoisting.`,
      `Reduces tree depth, flattening expensive styled components into div or View.`,
      `Evaluates useMedia and useTheme hooks, turning logical expressions into media queries and CSS variables.`,
    ]}
  />
</YStack>

The output is smaller bundles, better runtime performance, and many more native primitives used on the web.

Here's what it does, in code:

<TamaguiExamplesCode />

See [more examples on the homepage](/).

Notice that the compiler turned the `Text` into a `p`, and the `YStack` into a `div` (on native, this would be `Text` and `View`). This is known as tree-flattening, and for both web and native it yields very nice improvements to render performance.

This is a typical performance improvement, where much of the gains come from flattening:

<YStack my="$2">
  <BenchmarkChartWeb />
</YStack>

Across a few apps, we've seen 30-50% of components typically flatten, with a higher percent achievable just by being aware of how the flattening optimizes (adding the `// debug` comment to the top of the file will show a fuller output).

Meanwhile, on Native, because we can't optimize to anything beyond vanilla React Native code, the gains are less. Still, the results are impressive given you now have performance within 5% of hand-optimizing React Native code, except you get a whole suite of features for free.

<YStack my="$2">
  <BenchmarkChartNative />
</YStack>

You can see [more Benchmarks with explanations here](/docs/intro/benchmarks).

The compiler itself deserves more detail, which we'll expand on in the blog. For now, this serves as a decent introduction.

Compilers can dramatically improve code sharing without the typical sacrifice of performance. They don't solve every problem of universal apps, but by making responsive styling, themes and interactive styles all perform at native levels, they unlock sharing a much larger percentage of the components located in the middle to bottom of the render tree in apps.

It gives us a new choice:

<Table my="$8">
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head></TableCell>
    <TableCell>4</TableCell>
  </TableCol>
  <TableCol>
    <TableCell head>Strategy</TableCell>
    <TableCell>Universal + Compiler</TableCell>

    <TableCell>✅</TableCell>
  </TableCol>

</Table>
