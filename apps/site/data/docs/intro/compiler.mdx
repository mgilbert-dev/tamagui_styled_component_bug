<TLDR>

The Tamagui compiler is good for 5-15% better performance on Native, but anywhere from 50-300% better performance on web, without hand-optimization.

<IntroParagraph>
  React Native has a good motto:{' '}
  <span style={{ color: 'var(--yellow10)' }}>learn once, write anywhere</span>. It's an admission
  that your app only feels good as much as it uses the native platform primitives.

Most people choose two and get on with it. They may just focus on web or native to start. Or maybe they have a lot of money, so they just write everything twice.

If you do need both a native and web app, you can `npm install` one of the many React Native + Web UI kits... but in exchange, you'll get ~70% off Lighthouse scores, main-thread jank, and neverending stress over your performance budget.
