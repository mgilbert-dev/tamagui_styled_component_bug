Tamagui is a full-featured UI kit built on top of `@tamagui/core`.

The instructions here are for `tamagui`, the complete set of components designed to build universal apps. It's fully tree-shakeable, so your bundler should only add components you import.

If you'd rather build your own design system on top of core, [see the Design Systems guide](/docs/guides/design-systems).

### Quick Start

Try out [create-tamagui](/docs/guides/create-tamagui) for a helpful starter template which comes with `@tamagui/shorthands` and `@tamagui/theme-base` for easy default shorthands, themes and tokens.

### Install

```bash
npm install tamagui
```

### Environment variables

Be sure to set the environment variable `TAMAGUI_TARGET` to the string `web` or `native`, respectively.

### Config file

Create a `tamagui.config.ts` file at the root of your project.

From there you'll export default the result of `createTamagui`, like so:

```tsx
import { createTamagui } from '@tamagui/core'
import { shorthands } from '@tamagui/shorthands'
import { themes, tokens } from '@tamagui/theme-base'

export default createTamagui({
  themes,
  tokens,
  shorthands,
})
```

You'll need to install these packages:

```sh
yarn add @tamagui/shorthands @tamagui/theme-base
```

You can import `createTamagui` from either `tamagui` or `@tamagui/core` depending on which you decide to use.

The next page, [Configuration](/docs/core/configuration) explains this file in detail.

### Root export

Import and use the `TamaguiProvider` component as the top component in your app.

```tsx line=8-14
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from './tamagui.config'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      {/* if you want nice React 18 concurrent hydration, you'll want Suspense near the root */}
      <Suspense>
        <AppContents />
      </Suspense>
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

TamaguiProvider has optional props, [see the docs for them here](/docs/core/configuration#using-tamagui-provider).

### Done!

You're now ready to use Tamagui, import and use any components:

<Preview>
  <DemoButton />
</Preview>

```tsx class=preview line=5
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default function Demo() {
  return <Button>Button</Button>
}
```

We recommend [spending time understanding configuration](/docs/core/configuration) from here, skipping over the Compiler setup. The compiler is optional and should be saved for setting up after you've built something you'd like to test it with.
