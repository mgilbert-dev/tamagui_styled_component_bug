- tag in styled() causing ssr issue maybe not setting tag
- escape hatch for html props `htmlProps` ?
- transpile / prod build
- get styled() size: working
- optimize regular styled() usage
- add: dev mode can add data-is to properties if you want
- pressStyle test
- variants [number] [any] would be nice
  - instead of any variant: { size: (x: typed) => {} } could be inferred? fully dynamic basically
- createComponent move most hooks into dynamic loaded features, see useFeatures
  - pressable, responderEvents, layout, press events, usePlatformMethods
- createComponent test re-renders with theme changes
- onLayout
- as={T} generic?
- as={Animated.Text}
- implement variants
- make styled() accept any component (see Input.tsx)
- fix // TODO comments
- // TODO this ternary is being compiled backwards!
- all html tags (pre, code, etc)
- defaults (font size)
pread, color] | { x, y, spread, color }
- in app custom usage through pointing to a file
- gzip stuff on site
- blog
- document process.env.TARGET
  - instead of isWeb/isNative checks in places be set to the "strategy" isStyleSheet vs isCSS ?
- use new react insert stylesheet hook
- [perf] no need to concat classname at compile className={} if not flattening because it happens in createComponent
- media based hoverStyle/pressStyle may need runtime equivalent!
- sizeFont / sizeLineHeight could actually be solution to multiple
- to build faster
- babel add displayname
- font weight tokens
- a way for font token size/weight/etc to be per-font
- document theme `pink-light` and `pink-dark` helper
- Button text props would be nice flattened onto it and only supporting the specific text props (that way can extract)
- Button needs size={} which adjusts: padding, spacing, text size (icon size?)
