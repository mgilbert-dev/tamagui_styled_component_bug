Tamagui takes the next steps towards truly universal styling for React apps.

It was born to allow **sharing more code between native and web components** — with all the [modern styling features we've grown love](/docs/intro/introduction).

Until today, sharing code between native and web has had some big downsides, especially with inline styling, responsive styling and themes.

The biggest downside is a large performance hit if you leave styles inline or use hooks for themes/responsivity. It ends up running much more time- and memory-hungry operations in JavaScript — on the web, critically, on the same thead as the rest of your UI. This causes major issues with jank, and limitations rendering deeper trees.

Tamagui tackles these problems with an optimizing compiler. It enables:

### Inline styles without overhead

An optimizing compiler extracts almost all styles you write, even if they're inside conditional ternaries or spread objects. It pulls them out of your JS bundle and into atomic CSS.

### Fast responsive styles

Use hooks and inline responsive styling props without worry, again even with ternaries or other logical operations interspersed, and get clean CSS media queries extracted. On native, your render function will have less work while still allowing you to enjoy the terser style syntax and `useMedia` hook.

### Native themes

Use powerful themes that extract on the web to CSS variables, leaving your tree clear of large amounts of objects.

Tamagui is three things:

### Core: Create your Design System

[@tamagui/core](/docs/core/styled) provides fast primitives for inline styles _as well as_ hooks - even for media queries and themes - that work the same on native as they do web.

### Tamagui: Universal UI Kit

[tamagui](/docs/components/stacks) is a batteries-included UI Kit that builds on core with easy-to-use universal components.

### Static: Optimizing compiler

`@tamagui/static` works with both of the above (with webpack and babel). It outputs faster code, flattens your trees, and tunes your styles perfectly to each platform.

## History

We're building Tamagui hand-in-hand with an app that needs to have a great experience on both web and native. As a small team, being able to share as much code as possible between the platforms has many upsides.

Tamagui began as a fork of [JSXStyle](https://github.com/jsxstyle/jsxstyle), rebuilt to support [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/). We added basic support for [useMedia](/docs/core/useMedia) first, which let us share responsive components between web and native. Eventually, [useTheme](/docs/core/useMedia) was added when we added a dark mode.

With enough development, we decided it was worth sharing it with the world.

There was only one problem: design systems had gotten _really good_ in the last few years — better syntax, themes, variants, tokens, and shorthands. We'd built UI kits with these features in the past, but JSXStyle, and therefore Tamagui, didn't support them.

So, over the last month, I set out to modernize Tamagui. And I'm happy to announce it today in alpha, fully supporting all of the goodies of modern design systems, and more.

A big thanks is owed to the creators of both JSXStyle (for the compiler) and [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) (for inspiration on tokens and variants, and the bones of this website).

## Going forward

Tamagui is an ambitious project and still early in its life, but we've been using it for a couple years now and feel its ready to get out into the world.

We look forward to working with the community and helping it grow.
