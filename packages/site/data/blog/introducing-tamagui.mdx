Tamagui takes the next steps towards truly universal styling for React apps.

It was born to allow us to **share more code between native and web**, and do so with all the modern styling features we've grown love from themes to variants to typed inline styles.

We love inline styles, and being able to share components across platforms. But today, both have problems: they sacrifice performance, oftentimes dramatically so. On native, it's due to inline or dynamic styling requiring a lot of extra JavaScript at runtime. On web, it's the same, but even worse as you aren't using the platform-native primitives like CSS media queries and themes.

Tamagui attempts to solve these problems. It's three things:

- A **design system library** that provides fast primitives for inline styles _as well as_ hooks - even for media queries and themes - that work the same on native as they do web.
- A **UI kit** that builds on that library with easy to use universal components.
- An **optimizing compiler** that outputs faster code, tailored to each platform.

We built Tamagui hand-in-hand with a large app that needed to have a great experience on both web and native. As a small team, being able to share as much code as possible between the platforms has many upsides.

Tamagui began as a fork of [JSXStyle](https://github.com/jsxstyle/jsxstyle), rebuilt to support [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/). We added basic support for [useMedia](/docs/core/useMedia) first, which let us share responsive components between web and native. Eventually, [useTheme](/docs/core/useMedia) was added when we added a dark mode.

With enough development, we decided it was worth sharing it with the world.

There was only one problem: design systems had gotten _really good_ in the last few years â€” better syntax, themes, variants, tokens, and shorthands. We'd built UI kits with these features in the past, but JSXStyle, and therefore Tamagui, didn't support them.

So, over the last month, I set out to modernize Tamagui. And I'm happy to announce it today in alpha, fully supporting all of the goodies of modern design systems, and more.

A big thanks is owed to the creators of both JSXStyle (for the compiler) and [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) (for inspiration on tokens and variants, and the bones of this website).

Tamagui is an ambitious project and still early in its life, but we've been using it for a couple years now and feel its ready to get out into the world.

We look forward to working with the community and helping it grow.
