Tamagui makes a few baby steps forward for styling React apps.

It was born to allow us to share more code between native and web, and do so with all the modern styling features we've grown love from themes to typed inline styles.

Unfortunately, both inline styles and sharing code across platforms have problems — both sacrifice performance, oftentimes dramatically so, as they require running significantly more JavaScript in critically important areas. Plus, they don't output to platform-friendly (and fast) primitives like CSS media queries and themes.

Tamagui was born to resolve this. It's really three things:

- A **design system utility library** with props and hooks for media queries and themes that work the same across native and web.
- A higher-level **UI kit** built on top of that library.
- A **smart optimizing compiler** that outputs faster code, tailored to each platform.

We built Tamagui hand-in-hand with a large app that needed to have a great experience on both web and native. As a small team, being able to share as much code as possible between the platforms has many upsides.

Tamagui began as a fork of [JSXStyle](https://github.com/jsxstyle/jsxstyle), rebuilt to support [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/). We added basic support for [useMedia](/docs/core/useMedia) first, which let us share responsive components between web and native. Eventually, [useTheme](/docs/core/useMedia) was added when we added a dark mode.

With enough development, we decided it was worth sharing it with the world.

There was only one problem: design systems had gotten _really good_ in the last few years — better syntax, themes, variants, tokens, and shorthands. We'd built UI kits with these features in the past, but JSXStyle, and therefore Tamagui, didn't support them.

So, over the last month, I set out to modernize Tamagui. And I'm happy to announce it today in alpha, fully supporting all of the goodies of modern design systems, and more.

A big thanks is owed to the creators of both JSXStyle (for the compiler) and [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) (for inspiration on tokens and variants, and the bones of this website).

Tamagui is an ambitious project and still early in its life, but we've been using it for a couple years now and feel its ready to get out into the world.

We look forward to working with the community and helping it grow.
