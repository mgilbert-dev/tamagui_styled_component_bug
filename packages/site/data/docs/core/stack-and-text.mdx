description: The base views of @tamagui/core.

Beyond the Theme component which is just used for changing themes, `@tamagui/core` only exports two components for building views. This is because it's meant to be used as the base layer for building up your own design system.

If you just want to start building an app, we recommend starting with the Tamagui [Stacks](/docs/components/stacks) and [Text](/docs/components/Text) and not using `@tamagui/core`, which are unstyled.
