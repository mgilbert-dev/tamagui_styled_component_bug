description: How to create and use themes in Tamagui.
---

Themes in Tamagui are powerful because they can compose off each other nicely. They are meant to be fairly small, with tokens doing much of the heavy lifting.

Think of tokens as your base variables which can be shared downwards to themes. Themes meanwhile are meant to be concise, we typically define 10-15 or so "common" theme properties that let us then style the rest of our app - things like `color1`, `color2`, `bg1`, and `bg2`. We also have a set of light and dark colors, which we define onto their respective `dark` and `light` base themes.

Tamagui lets you access themes and tokens both in the same way. Let's start with an example of inline styling with a subset of the configuration:

```jsx
import { createTokens, createTamagui, YStack, Theme } from 'tamagui'

const tokens = createTokens({
  color: {
    darkRed: '#550000'
    lightRed: '#ff0000'
  }
})

const { Provider } = createTamagui({
  tokens,
  themes: {
    dark: {
      red: tokens.color.darkRed,
    },
    light: {
      red: tokens.color.lightRed,
    }
  }
})

export const App = () => (
  <Provider defaultTheme="light">
    <YStack backgroundColor="$red" />
    <Theme name="dark">
      <YStack backgroundColor="$red" />
    </Theme>
  </Provider>
)
```

In this example we've set up darkRed and lightRed variables and a a dark and light theme that use those variables. Tamagui will handle defining:

```css
:root {
  --colors-dark-red: #550000;
  --colors-light-red: #ff0000;
}

.theme--dark {
  --red: var(--colors-dark-red);
}

.theme--light {
  --red: var(--colors-light-red);
}
```

Which will automatically apply at runtime, or can be gathered for use in SSR using `Tamagui.getCSS()`.

Finally, the compiler on web will extract your views roughly as so:

```jsx
export const App = () => (
  <Provider defaultTheme="light">
    <div className="baCo-2nesi3" />
    <Theme name="dark">
      <div className="baCo-2nesi3" />
    </Theme>
  </Provider>
)

// CSS output:
//  .color-2nesi3 { background-color: var(--red); }
```

### Subset themes

One of the real powers of Tamagui is theme nesting, which we'll explain below, but which is important to understand. If you define a theme with the name in the form `[name]-[parentName]`, Tamagui handles `<Theme name="[name]" />` as though it's valid.
