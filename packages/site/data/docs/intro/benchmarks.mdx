title: Benchmarks
description: Performance tests and comparisons.
---

We've forked a common test suite for styling libraries. All tests were run in a production environment on a Macbook M1 Pro (2021). The [benchmarks](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/packages/benchmarks) are open-source.

<Notice>
  **Note**: Some of these libraries are **web-only**, which *should* have a big advantage as Tamagui
  supports the richer and larger React Native APIs. Still, we think Tamagui compares well.

Note, the last two tests are not really testing styling performance as much as the internals of the component. We think they don't represent a typical application, but we've left them in for completeness.

Tamagui truly shines with inline styles, themes and media queries, which are key to sharing between native/web. The plan is to add one more more realistic and mixed benchmark which really tests a typical complex app page. We think this test will be even more favorable for Tamagui.

### Simple component

Timing rendering a simple custom component.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.018 },
    { name: 'react-native-web', value: 0.057 },
    { name: 'Dripsy', value: 0.042 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 0.023 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 0.041 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Updating variants

Changing variants is fast at runtime, and even faster when compiled:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.026 },
    { name: 'react-native-web', value: 0.063 },
    { name: 'Dripsy', value: 0.108 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 0.037 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 0.069 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 0.081 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: Since styled-components and Emotion don't offer a first-class variant API, this was done via prop interpolation.

### Updating inline styles

Tamagui has a big advantage for inline styles, it's the only library to compile them.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.025 },
    { name: 'react-native-web', value: 0.06 },
    { name: 'Dripsy', value: 0.266 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 0.027 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 0.047 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Dynamic styles (no compilation)

Tamagui components are far more feature-rich than other styling libraries, so in the worst case where every component isn't extracted, you get middle-of-the-road performance. Basically, the next two tests represent extremely rare cases.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 17.25 },
    { name: 'Drispy', value: 57.5 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 14.5 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 49.01 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Mounting deep tree

In this test, we mount a tree with many nested nodes.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 11.92 },
    { name: 'Drispy', value: 44.43 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 8.32 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 42.49 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 51.4 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: This test was taken from the [styled-components benchmarks](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/main/packages/benchmarks).

## Summary

Tamagui greatly increases render performance and compares well to the best web-only style libraries. We plan to add comparisons to other cross-platform style libraries in the future as we should fare well against them.

Tamagui will also dramatically outperform for both media queries and themes, which we will publish in upcoming tests.
