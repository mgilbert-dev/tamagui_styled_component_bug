title: Benchmarks
description: Performance tests and comparisons.

We've forked a common test suite for styling libraries. All tests were run in a production environment on a Macbook M1 Pro (2021). The [benchmarks](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/src/packages/benchmarks) are open-source.

<Notice>
  **Note**: These benchmarks are competing against **web-only** style libraries. Those libraries
  should have a big advantage as they basically can render directly to DOM, while Tamagui supports
  the far richer and larger React Native API for every component. Still, we think Tamagui does well.
  <br />
  Next, we'll add a comparison to react-native-web and NativeBase, where it should show an ever
  bigger difference.
</Notice>

### Initial injection

The timing that it takes to inject the initial styles.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.018 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 0.023 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 0.041 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Updating variants

Changing variants is fast at runtime, and even faster when compiled:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.025 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 0.037 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 0.069 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 0.081 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: Since styled-components and Emotion don't offer a first-class variant API, this was done via prop interpolation.

### Updating inline styles

Tamagui has a big advantage for inline styles, it's the only library to compile them.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.025 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 0.027 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 0.047 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Dynamic styles (no compilation)

Tamagui components are far more feature-rich than other styling libraries, so in the worst case where every component isn't extracted, you get middle-of-the-road performance. The good news is, this is an extreme case and rare, and we have a lot of low hanging fruit for improvement.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 17.25 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 14.5 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 49.01 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: This test was taken from the [styled-components benchmarks](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/main/packages/benchmarks).

### Mounting deep tree

In this test, we mount a tree with many nested nodes.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 11.92 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 8.32 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 42.49 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 51.4 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: This test was taken from the [styled-components benchmarks](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/main/packages/benchmarks).

## Summary

Our benchmarks compare against Stitches, styled-components and Emotion because they're the most popular CSS-in-JS libraries for the web.

A few tests didn't run after upgrading Next.js for Emotion/styled-components, we've left them out for now.
