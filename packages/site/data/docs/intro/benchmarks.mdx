title: Benchmarks
description: Performance tests and comparisons.
---

We've forked a common test suite for styling libraries. All tests were run in a production environment on a Macbook M1 Pro (2021). The [benchmarks](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/packages/benchmarks) are open-source.

<Notice>
  **Note**: These benchmarks are compare against **web-only** style libraries which *should* have a
  big advantage as they simply render directly to DOM, while Tamagui supports the richer and larger
  React Native APIs. Still, we think Tamagui compares well.
</Notice>

### Initial injection

The timing that it takes to inject the initial styles.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.018 },
    { name: 'react-native-web', value: 0.057 },
    { name: 'Dripsy', value: 0.042 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 0.023 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 0.041 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Updating variants

Changing variants is fast at runtime, and even faster when compiled:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.026 },
    { name: 'react-native-web', value: 0.063 },
    { name: 'Dripsy', value: 0.108 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 0.037 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 0.069 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 0.081 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: Since styled-components and Emotion don't offer a first-class variant API, this was done via prop interpolation.

### Updating inline styles

Tamagui has a big advantage for inline styles, it's the only library to compile them.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 0.025 },
    { name: 'react-native-web', value: 0.06 },
    { name: 'Dripsy', value: 0.266 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 0.027 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 0.047 },
  ]}
/>
}

---

Note, the next two tests are not really testing styling performance as much as the internals of the component. We think they don't represent anything close to a typical application, but we've left them in to not seem like we're avoiding poor comparison.

We want to add a some new tests that better represent a good mix of use cases, as the current tests here are all very micro, and believe Tamagui will fare even better at more real-world comparisons.

### Dynamic styles (no compilation)

Tamagui components are far more feature-rich than other styling libraries, so in the worst case where every component isn't extracted, you get middle-of-the-road performance. Basically, the next two tests represent extremely rare cases.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 17.25 },
    { name: 'Drispy', value: 57.5 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 14.5 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 49.01 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: This test was taken from the [styled-components benchmarks](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/main/packages/benchmarks).

### Mounting deep tree

In this test, we mount a tree with many nested nodes.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Tamagui', value: 11.92 },
    { name: 'Drispy', value: 44.43 },
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 8.32 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 42.49 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 51.4 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: This test was taken from the [styled-components benchmarks](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/main/packages/benchmarks).

## Summary

Tamagui greatly increases render performance and compares well to the best web-only style libraries. We' plan to add comparisons to other cross-platform style libraries in the future as we should fare well against them.

Tamagui will also dramatically outperform for both media queries and themes, which we will publish in upcoming tests.
