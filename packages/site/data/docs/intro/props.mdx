title: Tamagui Props
description: All the properties supported on base Tamagui components.
---

Tamagui uses a superset of the style properties that are supported in React Native and React Native Web, and flattens them onto the direct properties of Stack and Text ([see why below](#why-inline-style-props)). For the full list of style and non-style props, see [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props) and [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props) from the react native documentation.

Beyond style properties, Tamagui adds `className` and `tag`:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'className',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          <strong>Web Only</strong>: Only affects web apps, giving an escape hatch to set the
          className directly. This works fully with the compiler, which will concat your defined
          className with its generated class names.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'tag',
      required: false,
      type: 'string',
      description: (
        <span>
          <strong>Web Only</strong>: Renders the final DOM property using the given tag.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'space',
      required: false,
      type: "boolean | string | TamaguiConfig['space']",
      description: (
        <span>
          Spacing is built into Tamagui and can accept a number or token.space value. This will
          filter out any nullish child elements and insert a spacer component between the remaining
          elements.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      name: 'debug',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description: (
        <span>
          When set to true Tamagui will output a variety of helpful information on how it parsed and
          applied styling.
        </span>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

For styling, Tamagui adds flattened transform properties, pseudo states and media queries:

### Flat transform properties

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'x',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ translateX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'y',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ translateY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'scale',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ scale }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'perspective',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ perspective }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'scaleX',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ scaleX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'scaleY',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ scaleY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'skewX',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ skewX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'skewY',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ skewY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'matrix',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ matrix }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotate',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotate }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotateY',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotateY }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotateX',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotateX }]',
    },
    {
      name: 'rotateZ',
      required: false,
      type: 'string | number',
      description: 'Maps to transform: [{ rotateZ }]',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Pseudo style props

Support for `hoverStyle` and `pressStyle` is helpful as it turns what typically is complex stateful code into pure CSS on web, and a more performant StyleSheet.create (compared to inline styles) for native. They can be used with media queries as well.

```jsx
<Text color="red" hoverStyle={{ color: 'blue' }} />
```

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'hoverStyle',
      required: false,
      type: 'TamaguiStyleProps',
    },
    {
      name: 'pressStyle',
      required: false,
      type: 'TamaguiStyleProps',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Media query style props

Based on whatever media queries you define in `createTamagui`, you can now use any of them to apply styling on native and web using the `$` prefix.

If you defined your media query like:

```jsx
createTamagui({
  media: {
    sm: { maxWidth: 800 }
  }
})
```

Then you can use it like:

```jsx
<Text color="red" $sm={{ color: 'blue' }} />
```

### Why inline style props?

#### üèé Faster to write

Inline styles have a few developer-speed benefits over `StyleSheet.create`: they require fewer imports and fewer lines of code, and they save you from jumping between the top and bottom of your file whenever you want to change a style so you can see exactly whats happening where it's happening.

#### üíÄ Easier to maintain, no dead code

`StyleSheet.create` forces you to manually link together the style with the node that's using the style. When you delete the style, you must delete the node, and when you delete a node, you have to manually check to be see if any other node is using that style before removing it.

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Less vertical space

When using shorthand style props, adding the overhead of a `style`, `css`, or `sx` prop will often make the difference in keeping your styles to one line vs multiple (when say using something like Prettier). With Typescript, the flat props feel natural and easy to understand.

#### ü§® Less forced naming

With StyleSheets you must name every style group, and even every ternary conditional style or else you lose performance. With inline styles you avoid both problems, leading to more creative experimentation and less friction.

#### üíÉ Encourages dynamic styles

Changing between a style that's determined by a ternary or conditional and one that's static shouldn't be a hard choice. With StyleSheet there's some friction as you have to either inline it and save time and readability or extract it to the bottom and gain performance. With inline styles (and the compiler) you no longer have that friction: convert any prop to have a ternary and it works the same, and runs fast.
